# Unique Word Count

Count the number of unique words in a given string of text, efficiently, in Rust.

**Input:**

A string of text.

**Processing:**

1.  "Words" are defined as sequences of alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9).
2.  The word count should be case-insensitive (e.g., "The" and "the" are considered the same word).
3.  Punctuation and other non-alphanumeric characters should be treated as word separators.

**Output:**

A single integer representing the number of unique words in the input string. Print the integer to standard out. Do not include additional information such as "Output:"
